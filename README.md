## :white_check_mark: Code Correction

I am a current student of the Ignite program presented by **[Rocketseat](https://www.rocketseat.com.br/)**.

Within every module, the course offers main challenges and extra assignments you can complete to enhance your skills and have fun.

This code correction task is one of the extra assignments offered to us. I had a lot of fun completing this challenge as it made my practice my code reviewing skills.

We were presented with a fully built API that contained a few errors on each of the routes. Rocketseat provided a series of automated tests that will show you where the code is failing to deliver, so that you can analyze and correct the mistakes
